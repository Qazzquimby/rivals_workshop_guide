# Installation

## VSCode

1. Download and install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open the extension manager (Ctrl+Shift+X), search for and install Rivals Workshop Assistant.

That's it. For a better experience, also install `rivals of aether gml support` the same way, for highlighting and
completion.

## GMEdit

VSCode is recommended over GMEdit at this time.
- GMEdit reloads less often, and needs manual confirmation to merge changes each time.
- GMEdit is more difficult to update, so its version of the Assistant may be updated less often and be missing features.

1. Go to
   the [plugin's release page](https://github.com/Rivals-Workshop-Community-Projects/rivals-workshop-assistant-gmedit/releases)
   .
2. Download the 'rivals-workshop-assistant-gmedit.zip' from that release.
3. In GMEdit preferences, near the bottom, click 'Plugins directory' to open the plugins directory.
4. Extract the zip file into the plugins directory.
5. Either reopen GMEdit or press Ctrl+Shift+I, then Ctrl+R to reload the editor.
