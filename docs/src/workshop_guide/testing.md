## Balance
Fun is almost always more important than balance. Be very careful when making changes for balance that you aren't losing fun. If an important unique part of your character is too strong, removing (or nerfing to useless ness) should be a last resort.
- Maybe weaken other areas of the character, though be careful about making them polarizing #todo
- Maybe change numbers, or add vulnerability and room for counterplay.
> Just try and make things fun. Balance can be for later. Doesn't matter if your character is balanced if no one plays them.

> Would you want to a play a game where every character has no unique tools? That's what happens when you overnerf.
