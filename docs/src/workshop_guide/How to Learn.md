This guide should hopefully work as a primary learning resource.
- General art and animation questions are more easily answered via google.
- For technical problems related to rivals, try [The Manual](https://www.rivalsofaether.com/workshop/)
- If you've already tried existing sources, or you have a very specific problem, the [Rivals](https://discord.gg/roa) and [ExW](https://discord.gg/GsDqfQyD)discords have channels to discuss and ask for help. People there are volunteering their time, so try to avoid asking something you could have learned elsewhere.
