# Quickstart

::: construction

This will contain a hands on tutorial, taking a user through setup and get them from clueless to ready to mess
around and explore.

- Set up game, template character, editor, [assistant](/assistant)
- Mess with movement, mess with normals, basic attack_update stuff, edit an animation. 

Each section links to where they can learn more in the learning paths below.

Until then, see [Mawral's guide](https://ko-fi.com/post/Rivals-of-Aether-Workshop-A-Complete-Starter-Guid-I2I42WI2N)
