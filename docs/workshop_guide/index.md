# Rivals Workshop Guide

Welcome to the Rivals Workshop Guide. 
This is an attempt to collect and curate the community's wisdom to make the modding journey less overwhelming.

If this guide does its job, it should take you from any skill level to as far as your time and work ethic will bring you, help you find whatever information you need, and stop you from falling into common traps along the way. 

When this guide isn't answering your question, try [[How to Learn]].

Though you'll probably want to skip around a bit, this guide is written in a meaningful order.
The next page button at the bottom right will always take you to the recommended next page.
