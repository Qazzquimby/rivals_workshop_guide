# Rivals Workshop Guide

Welcome to the Rivals Workshop Guide. This is an attempt to collect and curate the community's wisdom to make the
modding journey less overwhelming.

If this guide does its job, it should take you from any skill level to as far as your time and work ethic will bring
you, help you find whatever information you need, and stop you from falling into common traps along the way.

- ~~[Quickstart](quickstart) (EMPTY) gets you set up and able to explore.~~
- ~~[The Journey](process) (WIP) walks you through the process of building a character at a high level.~~
- [Programming Guide](programming/learning_path) teaches programming and language features.
- ~~[Programming Reference Documents](programming/reference) (EARLY WIP).~~
- [Art Guide](art) (WIP) covers all the theory necessary to make good Rivals art and animations.  
  Topics about animation and workflow are still to come.

Reference documentation is still early in development, but eventually any Rivals, Gml, or [Assistant](/assistant)
function should be accessible in the search bar, along with built in variables, scripts, error messages, etc.

When this guide isn't answering your question, try [[How to Learn]].
