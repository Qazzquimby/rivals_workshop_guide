### Normals
Normals should be compelling, and should at least somewhat play into the [[#Identity]] feel.

Be careful of redundant moves that serve the same purpose. One can easily overshadow another and reduce the number of real options available at a given time.

> Most of the normals i pick are just because I like how something looks or imagine it being cool in my head, but i do make sure to consider "does this really fit?"
> Half the time I'll add a little twist to spice things up a bit, like Zerra dtilt being belmont dtilt, but sends you fully into the air instead of landing again.

> I wanted to make sure all her moves had a purpose and fit well into her kit.
> That's where I worked around the idea that I would make a Pichu + Bayonetta styled character.
> Speedy glass cannons
