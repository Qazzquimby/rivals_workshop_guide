# Normals

Rough notes

:::

Normals should be compelling, and should express or refine the character's [identity](identity.md).

Be careful of redundant moves that serve the same purpose. One can easily overshadow another and reduce the number of
real options available at a given time.

> Most of the normals I pick are just because I like how something looks or imagine it being cool in my head, but i do make sure to consider "does this really fit?"
> Half the time I'll add a little twist to spice things up a bit, like Zerra dtilt being belmont dtilt, but sends you fully into the air instead of landing again.

> I wanted to make sure all her moves had a purpose and fit well into her kit.
> That's where I worked around the idea that I would make a Pichu + Bayonetta styled character.

## Intuitive Normals

Making normals intuitive makes the character easier to pick up and learn. Playing a new character, if you're in the air
above someone, you press down-air to try to hit them. If it turns out down-air does something funky that doesn't hit
below you, you'll need to unlearn that habit for that character.

Not every normal needs to be exactly what you'd expect, but beware of the tradeoff when making something weird.

**Hold Direction, Press Button, Hit Opponent**

When you press the attack button, the character should put out a hitbox in the general direction you're holding. Yes,
this is another common sense rule, and yes, if you're making a custom character you're probably doing this already! But,
it may be tempting to work around this step if you're porting an existing character from a non-platform-fighter game,
and don't have the correct animations or references to add a move with proper coverage. Unfortunately, doing this *will*
affect the character's intuitiveness in the long run. If you're able to, it is highly recommended to improvise a new
move instead.

There are a couple less obvious quirks that Rivals has when mapping hitboxes to buttons: Up-Strong should reach high
enough to hit above a platform, and Down-Strong should be able to hit an opponent who is overlapping with the character.
With these guidelines intact, you can ensure your character's general functions feel consistent with the Rivals' cast,
even if the attacks themselves are completely unique.

::: quote Sometimes it can be beneficial for a character to have 'moving' Normal attacks - one common example is a
Forward Tilt that steps the character a short distance forwards. In general, moving attacks will feel intuitive as long
as the attack direction matches the movement direction. But keep in mind that if aiming for a base-cast character feel,
even slight forward movements outside of jab combos should be added sparsely.

There are a few cases where creators may want to break this rule - in fact, a large number of the Rivals cast have a
normal attack which moves them in an unusual way. For example, Orcane can use his Forward-Aerial to propel himself
backwards, and Sylvanos's Back-Aerial can briefly stall his movement in the air. These sorts of moves will feel
unintuitive for players at first, but can be learned and adjusted to quickly. While I would recommend keeping these
kinds of moves to a minimum, they are worthwhile for the uniqueness they can add to a character.
