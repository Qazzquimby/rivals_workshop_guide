# Design

Design is maybe the most fun part of the creative process, but is nonetheless very important to take seriously.


In the beginning, you are totally free, untied to any decisions. Use this!

Changing a bad idea costs almost nothing early in the process, but costs a huge amount of time and energy after you've
invested heavily in it.

Consider many ideas. Lay a great foundation that you're excited to work on.
