# Predesign

## Background and Preferences
Especially on your first character, figure out what you enjoy.
Play a lot. Play rivals characters, other fighting games, other games and media.
Look for the elements that you find fun, that personally resonate with you.

## Intention
There's more than one objective in making a character. You may want to think of *why* you're interested in making a character, and what would make you happy with the finished project, to clarify your goals.

This guide assumes you're making the sort of character that would fit in with the Rivals cast. If you want to do something different, *you should*, but you should do it carefully, and be prepared for players to not understand your goal. This guide will try to make it clear why things are done the way they are, so you can avoid any traps off the path.

- Is it important that the character is competitively balanced or meet some standard?
    - #TODO section about curation.
- How much do you care about the community enjoying the character? What if the community wants changes you don't like?
    - Be careful hoping for your character to get a big reaction, it's often underwhelming.
    - Making something for yourself is entirely valid.
- Do you want your character to fit into Rivals, or be intentionally different? Characters might look or feel like a character from another game, or something totally new.
    - Do you want your character to be balanced against the workshop cast, or be intentionally stronger or weaker?
