# Gimmick and Specials

## Gimmick

A character's gimmick is often the best opportunity to reinforce their [identity](identity.md). Use the central mechanic
to encourage and facilitate the kind of play you want.

If you want a character who wants to stay very close to their opponent, you could reward that behavior with some kind of
aura effect, or facilitate it with an approach tool. That being said, a gimmick shouldn't be a script. It shouldn't feel
like there is only one possible style of play.

For Character Concepts I would really try to capture a character's "Central Mechanic."

Characters from smash and other games mish mash a moveset that best captures that character in the image of their
original game.

Rivals of Aether characters have a synergistic mechanic that ties a lot of their moves together.

Orcane Puddle, Eliana Steam, Etalus Ice, Zetterburn Burn, Kaboom Fuse.

It sounds pretty simple, but you'll be amazed at how many characters lack a central mechanic.

**Keep It Simple**

Starting with the obvious: characters can be made unique without having a plethora of gimmicks, alternate forms, special
variations, auto-combos and inventory systems layered on top of each other. Sometimes, less is simply more - especially
when you consider the difficulty of an opponent keeping track of every option your character has. Rivals's base roster
characters all have mostly simple attacks and a single core gimmick at most. In this way, neither player is overwhelmed
when figuring out their character's options, or when learning which options to avoid from their opponent.

Never be afraid of cutting gimmicks from a character, especially early on in development. Toggle and streamline them
over time so that only the best, most necessary ideas are kept. If you can explain your character's mechanic in two
short sentences, you should be good to go. 'Leftover' gimmick ideas can always be saved for a future character, which
can turn out even better than trying to cram everything into one.

**Synergy between Theme and Mechanics**

Rivals' gimmicks excel at being easy to understand at a glance, and the biggest reason for this is how their gimmicks
and their overall theme mesh in a simple and understandable way. Flowers that grow grass around them, ice that makes a
character slide, mech weapons that overheat after extended use - these are all existing ideas that commonly relate to
each other, and this helps them to be easily understood at a glance.

On the flipside, if a character used a box of TNT to deflect projectiles, or threw a skateboard as a healing item, the
player would be understandably confused. Because the imagery and the effect didn't match, the player ends up having the
wrong expectation of what the character's gimmick does. 'Dissonant' mechanics like these should be avoided early when
designing a new character. Setting up expectations through clear, recognizable visuals and strong, logical themes will
help your character feel intuitive from the moment they're picked up.

#### Setup and Payoff

Many gimmicks can be seen as setups and payoffs. Setup options may not be powerful on their own, but enable payoffs.
Payoffs may be unavailable or unimpressive normally, but become much stronger with setup.

- Zetterburn fire attacks set up strongs
- Absa clouds set up traps or stun into sweet spot punishes.
- Ranno poison sets up long bubbles

The primary goals in a match of RoA is to deal damage to enemies and knock them off the screen, but it's always fun to
add "sub objectives" that help the character fulfill the primary goals of the game.
