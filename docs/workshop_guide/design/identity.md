## Identity

Every character has an identity, creating a sort of feeling to play. Playing Absa feels very different from playing Zetterburn.  Different characters create different situations, and different attitudes towards play.

**Activities**
> Tech chasing, bait and punish, area denial, edge guarding, spacing, juggling ...

**Attitudes**
> Furious, patient, clever, reckless, durable, tricky ...

For me it's always been find one or two things that you want to do.
Those things are preferably super flexible and vague, like "speed is good" or "combo upward".
Base the kit around doing and interacting with those things in different ways.

A lot of what makes a character fun and unique is the cohesiveness of their feel.

The more tightly bound a character is to their identity, the more it will resonate with people. 

Find how you want the player to feel, and stay focused on that. 

Reinforce your character's identity at every opportunity.

Wrastor's identity is something like "flashy aerial combos", which is vague enough that it allows every part of his kit to support it.

\
Visually Wrastor is a bird, looking like a flamboyant action hero.

\
Mechanically, Wrastor has:
- Unique air-smashes
- Multiple jumps
- Good juggling options
- Jump canceling tilts
- Specials are all useful for setting up, extending, or finishing aerial combos.

\
The same exercise can be done for any character. Look for what glues them together, and how tightly bound they are to that idea.

**Kragg**: "Grounded superheavy with weird zoning", very well supported.

**Smash's Mario**: "Sorta generic brawler with unrelated specials", no effort at cohesion in the gameplay. The identity is closer to "stuff mario does in other games."

::: warn
Having a loose identity, is a valid design [intention](predesign.md#intention), particularly common when creating an
existing character.

Be wary that this will usually lead to a less compelling, shallower kit.

### Finding Identity
If you're feeling uninspired while building the identity, spend some more time in [predesign](predesign.md).
- What do you enjoy about other characters, even characters from other genres?
- Entertain small ideas. If you have a thought that wouldn't be hard to test, try it out. You don't need to commit to anything yet.
