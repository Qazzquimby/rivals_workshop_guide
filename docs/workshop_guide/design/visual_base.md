# Visuals Design

::: construction
Hi, people who know anything about art.

Right now the structure is

Design
- Talk about stuff that isn't pixel art specific. Posing, communication. Support working entirely on paper. Sketching key frame ideas.

Implementation
- Talk about turning those designs into pixel art animations. How to iterate pixel art roughs. How to animate.

Does that make sense? I think most people probably don't think in two phases like that, but I think it's probably good practice to teach?
When something is professional practice there's usually good reason.

This should probably cover
- Designing idle specifically.
- Visual design principles.

The below is rough notes.

The early stages of a character's visual design are difficult and important. Your first idea is probably not the best
you can do. Spend some time improving your design before committing.

While you're drafting thoughts on paper, don't get attached to specific details. Not everything communicates well in
spritework. A neat patterned belt in concept art might just look like noise in a sprite.

# Base Idle Pose

Focus first on finding a base idle pose, but the advice here should inform all visuals.

## Form and Personality

> Getting a character's design to feel right can be difficult even before touching pixel art.
> I start with a general kinda idea I want and then make a pose, and then try to fit the idea to the pose
> ~ Shplurmff

> ... Fighting games should tell as much story as they can in their gameplay.
> ... It’s up to the designers and the artists to explain as much about a character as possible through their visuals.
> ~ Dan Fornace

> The early concepts determine the physique of your character.
> Are they thin? Are they strong? Are they human or are they made of another material? How do they move? Do they have legs? Are they fast? Are they slow? Do they stand out compared to the rest of your roster? Do they stand out compared to other fighting games?
> ~ Dan Fornace

## Pose Design

### Base Idle Pose

The idle sprite's pose is extremely important in communicating what the character is about. It expresses the character's
personality and capabilities.

> The latter idle pose concepts determine the personality and style of your character.
> Are they arrogant? Are they scared? Are they reckless or are they prepared? Do they lumber or do they prance?
> Does their stance match the personality that you want this character to have?
> ~ Dan Fornace

> We worked on idle sprites that would show off personality when we could.
> Absa stands tall and aloof to act like the fight is beneath her.
> Maypul stands hunched and prepared to show that she can react and move at a moment’s notice.
> ~ Dan Fornace

> With a strong idle pose, you can use that as a guide for the rest of movement of the character.
> The personality that you have determined should influence everything that the character is going to do.
> ~ Dan Fornace

> I think having a good idle sprite is essential.
> The base idle frame really helps me understand what the character should be physically capable of.
> It's easier for me to imagine what the future moves look like.
> ~ Pandabomb

> You don’t have to be able to predict a character’s moveset just from the silhouette of their idle pose.
> But you should be able to get a high level idea what the character is going to be about.
