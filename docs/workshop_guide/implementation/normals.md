**Small hitboxes**

The most frequent issue tends to be characters who feel like they can't hit their opponents, due to their hitboxes being much smaller than the average character. Sometimes creators make the assumption that hitboxes need to be placed very carefully and evenly over their sprites, wrapping tidily around their fists and weapons -- however, hitboxes for base cast characters are sized generously, often having more reach than their sprites suggest.

Sometimes, a character's short range is due to both the character's hitboxes and their animation style. Since Rivals characters are fairly small, their attacks need to be exaggerated in order to function well in gameplay. If their arm doesn't reach far outside of their silhouette, their hitbox won't be reaching far enough to hit their opponent either.

When designing moves, remember to think about the space they will cover in terms of hitboxes and hurtboxes. Most of all, don't be afraid to break, stretch and exaggerate your attack poses as much as you can. Even if you overdo it by accident, scaling down a large attack is much less work than scaling up a small attack.

**Too Little Damage**

Interestingly, characters dealing too much damage isn't as common an issue as characters that don't deal enough damage. Even when making a speedy combo-centric character, you should be careful not to lower your character's damage to the point of crippling them. Base cast characters tend to deal 4-12% damage with each of their normal attacks, and all of them have high combo potential to boot. If your character is averaging 1-3% per hit, they'll need to get in a lot of hits reliably in order to keep up with the average character.

It's worth noting that the damage a character deals directly affects the pacing of a match. Therefore, if your character requires flawless mastery and perfectly executed combos to deal 'normal' damage, they may end up feeling weak and tiresome for casual players, or even skilled players against equally skilled opponents. There is no fixed rule for how much damage each attack should deal, but instead I would recommend keeping match lengths in mind when adjusting your character's damage output.

Steep & Unpredictable Knockback Angles

Attack angles in Rivals of Aether typically range between 40 and 90. Angles below this can be difficult to predict and DI, and can lead to frustrating early KOs. Sticking with angles of 35 or higher is generally a good idea, unless there is a good reason to go lower. Absa's Back-Air sweetspot has the steepest angle in the game at 32.

Another thing to avoid is having too many different knockback angles on a single attack. One or two angles should suffice for most attacks, three at the very most. Any more than this can lead to similar frustration, as the opponent attempts to guess which angle an attack will send them in.
