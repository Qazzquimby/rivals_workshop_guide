# Implementation

**BUCKLE UP, IT'S WORK TIME**

Implementation is the process of turning your ideas from [the design phase](design) into a character, as efficiently as
possible.

## Be Agile

Remember from design: the less time you've invested in something, the cheaper it is to change direction. It's best to
approach implementation by gradually improving and testing.

If something needs to change, you want to learn that as quickly as possible. Whatever part of the design seems least
certain to work, test a rough version playable quickly. Focus on learning what the character will be like when
they're finished. This is why the chapter on gimmick and specials is first.

The less work that has been done, the cheaper it is to change direction. Don't get lost polishing details before you've
tested the big ideas.
- Postpone details of moves like cooldowns, cancels, resources.
- Use quick minimal art you feel okay with discarding.

Keep your design ideas in mind. Maybe prototype several ideas and see which you prefer.



## Iteration to Completion

As you become confident a part of your character will work, and are happy with its design, you can gradually add polish.
It doesn't have to be release-ready quality right away.

Continually refine the parts you're most confident on, while testing and getting feedback on the rest.
