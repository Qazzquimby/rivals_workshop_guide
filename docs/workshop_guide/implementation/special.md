# Gimmick and Specials

This is the most technically challenging part of a character. Nearly all difficult programming will be part of your
character's weird features.

## Balance

**Unchecked Movement Mechanics**

Rivals has a handful of 'hidden' universal mechanics, which can make certain character stats incredibly powerful in the
right hands. Maybe they have a powerful wavedash, a 'hitfall' aerial that leads into an infinite combo, or the ability
to cover the entire stage with a Dash-Attack-Cancelled-Up-Strong. If a character is balanced without these mechanics in
mind, the creator may later discover that their character is much stronger than they intended it to be.

It can be very difficult for a new creator to catch every possible exploit on their first try, as many of the techniques
require practice to pull off. However, it's still a good idea to learn about what is possible, and/or to ask a
playtesting volunteer who is experienced with them.
The [Rivals Of Aether Academy Discord](https://discord.com/invite/353GRZR)
and [this video guide by Sawtooth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWTgN8nq6Rk) do a good job of explaining all the
Rivals-specific jargon that you'll need to watch out for.
