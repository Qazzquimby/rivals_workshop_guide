# Attitude

## Expectations
 
It takes a long time.
> Remember that doing a workshop character will take a while, it shouldn’t be easy.
> ~ Wackmaster

> Do not expect your character to be perfect day 1, month 1, or even year 1. Don't let people rush you.
> ~ Chaokobon

Focus on enjoying the process, not on meeting high standards.
> Just make stuff that’s fun for you and take your time. Just make stuff and worry about success later
> ~ FungiWizard

> Make the character to the best of your ability. 
> Don't stress too much about how high quality it is while it's still in development. 
> Overtime as you get better, you might spot areas where you can improve the character and you can always go back and fix them.
> ~ BountyXSnipe

Keep a reasonable scope. Better to release something simple than get burned out on the road to releasing something huge.
> Mistakes will be made. Try not to over-complicate your first character.
> Amber was going to have Empowered variants for all her moves, including parry. I scrapped that idea as I think it ended up being too complex, time consuming. Amber would have taken 2 years to finish if I stayed with that idea.
> After I cut that idea to just specials, I felt a huge relief, like a giant weight was released off my shoulders.
> ~ BountyXSnipe

The response to your character when it's released can be underwhelming. Releasing a character is a huge success for you to celebrate, but attention is split between many excellent mods. Focus on self validation and the joy of creating, not on the community response.
>  Don't expect big success, especially with your first character. 
>  Be prepared to need patches, big or small. 
>  My recommendation is to not set the bar high in general, for your first character.
>  Your first character is to get the experience of making one.
>  ~ BountyXSnipe

## Lifestyle

### Work-Life Balance
Character's are huge passion projects and can consume a lot of time.
Don't neglect other areas of your life. Eat and sleep properly.
> I poured all my efforts and my soul into a single character.
> Left practically no room for myself.
> I wouldn't encourage people to work as hard as I did. It was too costly on one's self.
> ~ BountyXSnipe

### Burnout 
> Pace yourself. Burnout is terrible for the mind.
> Don’t give up, but take a bit of a break.
> Forcing creativity where there is none will usually result in a poor outcome.
> ~ WACKMASTER
