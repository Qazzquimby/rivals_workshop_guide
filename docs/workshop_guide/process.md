# Process

This overviews the process of creating a character.
The phases blur into each other. Each phase informs the decision of those following.
This applies to all production, programming or art.

## Design
In the beginning, you are totally free, untied to any decisions. Use this!

Changing a bad idea costs almost nothing early in the process, but costs a huge amount of time and energy after you've
invested heavily in it. 

Consider many ideas. Lay a great foundation that you're excited to work on.

## Early Prototypes
Get a rough version playable quickly. The less work that has been done, the cheaper it is to change direction. Don't get lost polishing details when you haven't tested the big ideas yet. 
- Postpone complex elements of moves like cooldowns, cancels, resources.
- Use quick minimal art you feel okay with discarding.

Keep your design ideas in mind. When working with quick prototypes, it is easy to change direction if you don't like where you're headed. Maybe prototype several ideas and see which you prefer.

Parts of the character you're least sure of, like their unique mechanic, or a hard to animate feature, should be prototyped first since they're most likely to need adjustment. Focus on learning what the character will be like when they're finished.

If an important part will be very hard to prototype, like a crazy gimmick, you might want to ask [the discord's](https://discord.gg/roa) thoughts on it before you invest that time.

Once you have part of the character prototyped, test it. 
- Is the ability fun to play with and against?
- Do people like your idle sprite? Does [the discord's](https://discord.gg/roa) modding-critique channel have recommendations?
[[Testing|More on testing here]], but early on you should be focusing only on fun and appeal.

## Iteration to Completion
As you become confident a part of your character will work, and are happy with its design, you can gradually add polish. It doesn't have to be release-ready quality right away.

Continually refine the parts you're most confident on, while testing and getting feedback on the rest.

## Release
You have to do it at some point! When you have something near completion, read [Deathloops](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/deathloops.html) by the maker of Spelunky.

Prepare your expectations. The community's attention is spread between many mods, and the fanfare may be quieter than expected.
