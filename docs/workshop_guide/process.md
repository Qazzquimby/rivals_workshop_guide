# Process Overview

This overviews the entire process of creating a character.

The phases blur into each other somewhat, but each phase informs the decisions of those after.

## Design

[Full article](design)

Creating a character is a huge amount of effort. A common theme in this guide will be for avoiding investing much time
in work you'll later need to throw away.

A character can't be better than the ideas it's made from. The design phase improves your ideas early, so that your
later time is well spent.

## Implementation

You should have a good idea where you're going now. Implementing is about going from ideas to finished product as
efficiently as possible.

You'll learn what you need, test out the most experimental parts first, and *do a tonne of work.*

The hard part is done!

Next is optionally handling feedback, fixing missed bugs, polishing, and fine-tuning balance.
