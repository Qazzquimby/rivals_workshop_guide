# Iteration

This overviews the entire process of creating a character.

The phases blur into each other somewhat, but each phase informs the decisions of those after.

I'm going to ditch the Design/Implementation dichotomy.

The truth is you go through many fuzzy stages from concept to polish, not two, and they blend into each other enough
that it'd be a disservice to draw a thick line.

Put this after core concept stuff.

Pick a small thing, iterate, test it

## What to do next

When you start the project, you only have a fuzzy idea of the end result. You haven't had your best ideas yet, and
you're working with no feedback and no playtesting.

While you're working, you're not just moving towards a finished character, you're *learning what that character will be*
.

That means working on things that are:

- Important. Parts you don't want to compromise on. Things that will lay the foundation for the rest of the character.
- Uncertain. Experimental stuff that might not work, or need a lot of adjustment.

### Focus on the core

A character's kit is tightly interrelated. One normal effects the strength of another. Movement effects everything.
Gimmicks can completely change the rules.

To avoid needing to repeatedly change things, first draft the parts of your character that are most important to your
vision, so the rest of the character can adjust to fit them.

### Validate your important assumptions

Things that are important *and* uncertain, like a weird gimmick, are top priority to draft and test.

As you firm up your ideas, move on to the new most uncertain part, and the character gradually comes into focus.

## Iterate

### Draft the foundation before details

Don't get lost polishing details until you're confident in that direction.

#### Why?

A quick draft tells you a lot about how the final product will look. Doing quick drafts and tests is the fastest way to gain confidence in your decisions.

The less work that has been done, the cheaper it is to change direction. 
Avoiding investing much time in work you might later throw away in favor of a better idea.

A character can't be better than the ideas it's made from. Stay flexible and improve your ideas early, so that your
later time is well spent.

#### How?

- Postpone details of moves like cooldowns, cancels, resources.
- Use quick minimal art you feel okay with discarding.

Keep your design ideas in mind. Maybe prototype several ideas and see which you prefer.

Everything can be drafted. Animations can start with keyframes and rough sketches. Simpler versions of specials can be
made before the real ability. Numbers can be guessed before they're fine-tuned.
