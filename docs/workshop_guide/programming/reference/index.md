# Programming Reference

This is meant to be an easily searchable repository of knowledge for quick reference while working.

Like a dictionary, it's not meant to be read like a guide.

While this is in construction, try the following:

- [Official workshop documentation](https://rivalsofaether.com/workshop/) 
- [Standard gml features](http://docs.yoyogames.com/source/dadiospice/002_reference/001_gml%20language%20overview/index.html)
- [Rivals specific gml features](https://yal.cc/r/17/ntt/gml/)

::: construction

- Document built in variables.

- Document functions with usage example and gotchas.
