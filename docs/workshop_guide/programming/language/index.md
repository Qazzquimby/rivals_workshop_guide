# Language Features

This section will explain the building blocks of Rivals' GML, the language used to script mods.

Similar to how English has nouns and verbs, punctuation and grammar, GML has some basic elements and rules.

It's important to understand that you don't need to be comfortable with everything at once. You can create a lot with
just the very basics, and expand into more complex features as you need them.
