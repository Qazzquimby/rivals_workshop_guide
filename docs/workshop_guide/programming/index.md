# Intro to Programming

For many, this is the modder's first adventure into programming. Welcome!

At first, you may run into confusions as things don't behave as you expect. As you gain comfort, you'll find you can
make all sorts of things. It will less bewildering and more like being a wizard.

A program is a series of instructions for the computer to follow, a bit like a recipe. Writing a program is a lot like
figuring out how to explain something in simple terms that the computer can understand.

The first challenge is learning what those terms are, so you can write code that does what you want.

Once you can do that, the focus is making your explanation simpler, with readable and organized code. This may sound
trivial, but good practices will let you work faster, run into fewer problems, and make changes more easily later on.
It's important!

Follow the next arrows at the bottom right to read in the recommended order.

There will be many small code examples. Try the samples, and try editing them to see what your changes do.

Have a character running and be able to edit code (see [quickstart](../quickstart)), and write code in `init.gml` to run
it once, or `update.gml` to run it every frame. Remember to press 'f5' to reload your changes.
