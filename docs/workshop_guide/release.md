## Do it

You have to do it at some point!

When you have something near completion, read [Deathloops](https://www.derekyu.com/makegames/deathloops.html) by the
maker of Spelunky.

## Reception

Prepare your expectations.

The community's attention is spread between many mods, and the fanfare may be quieter than expected.

::: quote I definitely want to warn people about this, based on personal experience.

Try not to set your expectations high, or you'll very likely face disappointment.

The higher the expectation, the more devastating the disappointment will be.

## Feedback

::: construction This is really bleak. Does anyone have a different perspective?

### Focus on polish, not rebuilding

Suggestions for drastic changes or reworks are usually unhelpful.

Healthy balance changes should keep your character's kit in mind and try to see how it can be adjusted to fit more with
base cast.

The time for drastic changes is early playtesting. At this time you should fine tune what you have.

### Be skeptical

Feedback mostly comes from lower skill players and can easily be misguided or unjustified. Use your own judgement, and only apply suggestions if you think it is the right idea. 
While you're newer to modding this may be more fairly often, but as you improve you will more often find that your original decision is better.

This isn't to say that misguided feedback is worthless, but that it needs to be used carefully, with thought.

::: quote 

Beware of feedback aimed for different [design intentions](design/predesign.md#intention) than yours.

Communication with a community is very difficult.

### How to interpret feedback

Pay attention to their reaction more than their suggestions.

Bad suggestions can still be helpful, because they reflect a player's feelings.

If your character is [intended](design/predesign.md#intention) to be fun to many people, gauging what parts of your
character are fun to play as or against can be helpful, even if the suggestions themselves are not.

Players are good at knowing what they don't enjoy, but usually poor at knowing how to improve it or what's causing them
to dislike it.

When a player says "X is poorly balanced," it usually means "X feels bad somehow."

When a lot of people feel similarly, that is a good indicator of what parts the community does and doesn't enjoy, even
if it doesn't tell you what changes to make.

Asking for more information can be helpful

- Do they have justification, like a comparison to the base cast?
- How long have they tried the character?
- Were they playing against a human or cpu? How seriously?
- How did the try to adjust their play to the thing they dislike?
- How do they think the character was meant to play?

### Avoid Nerf Culture

Community balance feedback tends to ask for nerfs more than buffs.

Fun is usually the ultimate goal. Be very careful when making changes for balance that you aren't losing much fun.

::: quote Just try to make things fun. Balance can be for later. Doesn't matter if your character is balanced if no one
plays them.
~ Shplurmff
:::

If an important unique part of your character is too strong, removing (or nerfing to uselessness) should be a last
resort.

- Maybe weaken other areas of the character, though be careful about making them polarizing #todo
- Maybe change numbers, or add vulnerability and room for counterplay.

Heavy nerfing leads to many low powered characters, weaker than the base Rivals cast.

::: quote Would you want to a play a game where every character has no unique tools? That's what happens when you
overnerf.

### Good Feedback

Good feedback is hard to give and hard to come by.

When aiming for competitive balance, the more skilled the reviewer, the more credible their advice.
::: quote Not every pro competitive player fully understands Rivals' design philosophy or how things work in general,

not every big modder looks at things the same way.

The best you can do is take everyone's take with a grain of salt, no matter who they are.
