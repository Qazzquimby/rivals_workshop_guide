*"What advice would you give a new modder?"*

Rather than being about coding or art, the answer is usually on this page.

Creating a Rivals character is a huge undertaking. It takes time, energy, and perseverance.

Remember that doing a workshop character will take a while, it shouldn’t be easy.

Do not expect your character to be perfect day 1, month 1, or even year 1. 

Don't let people rush you.

Because there is so much work, it's important to enjoy the process. Making a character can be a lot of fun, or it can be stressful and unhealthy.

Don't punish yourself for not meeting some set of standards. Don't push yourself past what you enjoy. 

::: quote
Just make stuff that’s fun for you and take your time. 

Just make stuff and worry about success later.

::: quote
Make the character to the best of your ability. 

Don't stress too much about how high quality it is while it's still in development. 

Overtime as you get better, you might spot areas where you can improve the character,
and you can always go back and fix them.

Pace yourself. Burnout is terrible for the mind.

Don’t give up, but take a bit of a break.

Forcing creativity where there is none will usually result in a poor outcome.

Keep a reasonable scope. Better to release something simple than get burned out on the road to releasing something huge.

::: quote
Mistakes will be made. Try not to over-complicate your first character.

Amber was going to have Empowered variants for all her moves, including parry. I scrapped that idea as I think it ended up being too complex, time consuming. Amber would have taken 2 years to finish if I stayed with that idea.

After I cut that idea to just specials, I felt a huge relief, like a giant weight was released off my shoulders.

Character's are huge passion projects and can consume a lot of time.
Don't neglect other areas of your life. Eat and sleep properly.

::: quote
I poured all my efforts and my soul into a single character.

Left practically no room for myself.

I wouldn't encourage people to work as hard as I did. It was too costly on one's self.

The response to your character when it's released can be underwhelming. Releasing a character is a huge success for you to celebrate, but attention is split between many excellent mods. Focus on self validation and the joy of creating, not on the community response.

::: quote
Don't expect big success, especially with your first character.

Be prepared to need patches, big or small.

My recommendation is to not set the bar high in general, for your first character.

Your first character is to get the experience of making one.
