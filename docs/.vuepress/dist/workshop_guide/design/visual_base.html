you can do. Spend some time improving your design before committing.</p> <p>While you're drafting thoughts on paper, don't get attached to specific details. Not everything communicates well in
spritework. A neat patterned belt in concept art might just look like noise in a sprite.</p> <h1 id="communication"><a href="#communication" class="header-anchor">#</a> Communication</h1> <p>The primary function of character visuals are to communicate what's happening quickly and clearly.</p> <div class="custom-block quote"><p><strong>Make It Obvious</strong></p> <p>You can make characters feel more intuitive by tying clues and hints into the character itself. Well made animations,
sound cues and pointers can seamlessly make a character more understandable, even when being picked up or fought against
for the first time. If done well, an experienced player should be able to figure out the majority of a character's tools
with only minimal reading beforehand.</p> <p><img src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/useruploads/display/13ea369e-7d3d-487d-a51c-ecab76604c6b_int5.png" alt=""></p> <p>The majority of a character's hints should be conveyed through the character's animation and audio. A good rule of thumb
is to have the character look in the direction they are attacking in, and exaggerate the character's action as much as
possible so that it reads clearly. Use effects or smears to lead the eye, and have flashes or sound cues to warn
opponents of an imminent threat. When the attack hits, use appropriate hitpause, hitsparks and sound effects to tell the
player how strong that attack was. All of this feedback amounts to the player getting a full impression of a move from
the moment they press the button.</p> <p>More obvious cues may be needed in some cases, such as glowing auras, big icons and pointer arrows to tell players about
important mechanics. I think that it is best to use obvious cues for abstract, videogame-esque concepts, such as meters,
charge attacks, status effects and other gimmicks that don't follow real-world logic. Adding too many obvious cues can
be distracting however, and it can lessen the fun of figuring out a character naturally. It is up to the creator to find
a good balance between helping the player find the character's tools, and risking mechanics that the player won't
discover on their own.</p> <p>~ <a href="https://ko-fi.com/post/Rivals-Workshop-Guide-Making-Intuitive-Characters-F1F62NFM1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mawral<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p></div> <p>Everything needs to be clear.

This lets
players identify which attack is being used and respond to it correctly. If the startup poses are too similar, certain
attacks could be mistaken for other ones until after they've hit the opponent. Attacks that are 'obscured' in this way
will frustrate opponents trying to counter them, and can make the character much harder to beat than they would be
otherwise.</p> <p>Pay special attention to the first couple frames of your attacks, making sure their outlines stand out from each other
and from their 'idle' pose. Strong attacks especially should have clear, unmistakable poses to properly communicate to
the opposing player.</p> <p>~ <a href="https://ko-fi.com/post/RoA-Workshop-Guide--5-Common-Character-Flaws-Ho-Y8Y23QCQX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mawral<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p></div> <p>Body parts that the character uses to attack should be especially visible, as they make attacks clearer.
